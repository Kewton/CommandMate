  "quality_assessment": "The Issue #308 implementation is high quality overall. All design policy checklist items (D1-003, D1-004, D1-007, D2-001, D2-002, D2-003, D2-005, D3-001, D3-004, D4-001, D4-002, D4-003) have been properly implemented. JSDoc comments are present and accurate. The SOLID principles are well applied: DI pattern for basePath injection, SRP via resolveDefaultBasePath() extraction, consistent DRY patterns with env.ts. Security measures (D4-001 basePath non-disclosure, D4-002 targetDir type validation, D4-003 targetPath non-disclosure) are correctly implemented. Test coverage is comprehensive with 47 unit tests and 12 integration tests covering basePath resolution priority, deprecation warnings, path normalization, security error messages, and API endpoint behavior. Only minor improvements were needed: removing 3 unused imports and adding a @returns JSDoc tag.",
