/**
 * Submit-verified message sender (Issues #1469, #1470, #1471).
 *
 * A single shared helper that replaces the seven near-identical
 * "type body -> press Enter -> maybe recover paste" sequences previously
 * duplicated across session-key-sender.ts and every cli-tools/*.ts sendMessage(),
 * plus the terminal API route's raw `sendKeys(command)` batch send.
 *
 * Why this exists (root cause):
 *   tmux `send-keys <body> C-m` batches the body and Enter into a SINGLE command.
 *   ink/React TUIs (Claude Code, Codex, ...) treat the injected body as a
 *   bracketed paste and swallow the trailing C-m as a newline inside the paste
 *   buffer, so the message is typed but never submitted. The recovery that used
 *   to guard this was gated on `message.includes('\n')` (single-line messages
 *   skipped entirely), keyed off Claude's version-specific `[Pasted text #\d+`
 *   string, and never verified that submit actually happened (fire-and-forget).
 *
 * This helper fixes all three:
 *   1. Body and Enter are ALWAYS sent as separate tmux commands with a delay
 *      between them (never a single body+C-m batch).
 *   2. Recovery + verification apply to EVERY message (no `\n` gate).
 *   3. After submit it reads the pane back and confirms the message actually
 *      left the input box (empty input line) or the tool began generating.
 *      If it is still pending it resends Enter, bounded; if it can never be
 *      confirmed it THROWS (callers must not report success on a stuck send).
 *
 * The verification is intentionally NOT keyed off the version-specific
 * `[Pasted text #\d+` placeholder. That placeholder is used only as one
 * "still pending" positive signal (broadened to be version-resilient); the
 * primary decision is "is the message still sitting on the input line?".
 *
 * Issue #1501 hardens the "still pending" branch. A TUI completion popup can
 * REPLACE the typed body with a different command (`/status` -> `/statusline`,
 * `/review` -> `/teamwork-preview`) when Enter selects a highlighted suggestion.
 * The old substring check misread the replacement as "still typed" and resent
 * Enter (executing the wrong command), or as "submitted" and left the residual
 * behind (detonating on the next send). The decision is now three-valued —
 * submitted / pending / replaced — and a `replaced` verdict clears the input
 * line and THROWS instead of resending Enter (see classifySubmit).
 *
 * Issue #1880 closes the hole on the OTHER side of the send. Everything above
 * verifies what happens after Enter; nothing looked at what was already in the
 * composer before the body was typed. `sendKeys` injects the body as plain
 * keystrokes at the TUI's CURRENT CURSOR POSITION, so residual text is spliced
 * into the body instead of being replaced by it. #1878 measured four shapes of
 * that damage: content mutation (`echo PREFILLED` + body), slash-command
 * demotion (a `/cost` body typed after residual is no longer `/`-initial),
 * order inversion when the cursor sat at column 0, and — worst — total loss of
 * the body when the RESIDUAL started with `/` (`/costZZTOP…` is an
 * `Unknown command`, so the message never reaches the model at all). All four
 * reported `exit 0` / `Message sent.` / `sessionStatus: ready`, i.e. they were
 * indistinguishable from a clean send by every signal a caller has. The
 * composer is therefore emptied and read back BEFORE the body is typed — see
 * {@link clearComposerBeforeSend}.
