  "notes": "All 4 phases implemented successfully. Phase 1 (z-index unification) resolves the white screen issue on iPad fullscreen by removing z-[9999] from Modal.tsx and unifying Toast/ContextMenu to use Z_INDEX constants with inline styles. Phase 2 (swipe/scroll separation) prevents unintended fullscreen exit during scroll by adding isInsideScrollableElement detection to useSwipeGesture.ts. Phase 3 (iPad responsive) confirmed AppShell.tsx and WorktreeDesktopLayout.tsx need no changes for iPad horizontal layout; SearchBar.tsx updated to use MOBILE_BREAKPOINT constant. Phase 4 (tests) added 20 new tests (15 z-index + 5 scrollable detection). Pre-existing env.test.ts failures (9 tests) are unrelated to this change.",
  "message": "TDD implementation complete. All acceptance criteria addressed. Zero static analysis errors."
